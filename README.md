<p id="description">The "Web Service Classification Using GCN" project is a powerful tool that leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify web services based on their functionalities and features. It aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for organizing and categorizing web services enabling developers and users to easily discover and utilize the appropriate services for their specific needs.</p>

  
  
<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Graph Convolutional Networks: The project employs GCNs a state-of-the-art deep learning technique for analyzing and understanding graph-structured data. By leveraging the graph structure of web services the model can capture complex relationships and dependencies among different services.
*   Service Classification: The system can automatically classify web services into different categories based on their functionality and attributes. It takes into account various factors such as input/output parameters descriptions and associated keywords enabling accurate and meaningful categorization.
*   Training and Evaluation: The project provides a comprehensive framework for training the GCN model using labeled web service data. It includes data preprocessing feature extraction and model training components. Evaluation metrics and visualization tools are also available to assess the model's performance and gain insights into its classification capabilities.
